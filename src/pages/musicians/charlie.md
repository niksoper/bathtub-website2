I'm 'retired', a granny, and a bipolar bear.  As my family live a fair distance away, I'm in the lucky position of filling most of my days with 'fun' stuff.  

I started playing flute, in Paris, in my twenties - my old teacher had bad breath and told me that playing flute would ultimately make my teeth fall out!  But here I am still 'tooting' and not yet toothlesss!!

I sing with Bath Rock Choir, and am trying to learn to play ukelele.   Music is at the heart of my days - it's been my only 'medication' for a number of years, keeping anxiety at bay and filling up my heart and spirit.
