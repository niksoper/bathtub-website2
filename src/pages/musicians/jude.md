I played the piano and oboe at school but then, work and children came along and the music petered out, somehow there never seemed enough time.

After being given an accordion much later (20 years or so!) I started playing again, mainly classical and folk music in big and small groups and a community swing band. After moving to Wiltshire I switched to soprano saxophone which is now my absolute favourite instrument.

I was really happy to find the BathTub Orchestra which I joined this year. For me, music is a huge pleasure and enhances life and mental health enormously. And playing with this group is the best! Ed our Musical Director arranges a wonderful, eclectic and sometimes quirky mix of tunes for us to play. We are a friendly and supportive mixed ability group and parts are tailored to suit us all. We are making a good sound and getting to perform in some great venues and events.
