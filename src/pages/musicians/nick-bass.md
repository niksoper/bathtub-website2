Before I joined BathTub I was a bedroom guitarist for many years. I didn't have much experience playing in a group and had only played to an audience once in my life!

My musical 'career' started on electric guitar when I was 17 and my best friend showed me how to play Marilyn Manson's cover of Sweet Dreams by Eurythmics - I was hooked from that day! The next few years I played almost nothing but Metallica covers (Nothing Else Matters and Master Of Puppets being favourites) before moving on to playing more prog, including an instrumental four-piece band called 'PMMF!' (search on soundcloud).

I started playing bass guitar in my early twenties and made my first ever live performance in 2009 at a work Christmas party in Washington D.C. with a band called Hot Shoop that I had formed with my wife.

I joined BathTub Orchestra when it first started in November 2018 when my wife said she wanted to join on clarinet. I was a bit nervous about joining because I didn't consider myself very experienced at playing in groups but the atmosphere is always very welcoming and it's fine to make a few mistakes in rehearsals.

We really enjoy our Tuesday rehearsals and it has been great to get some more experience playing in front of live audiences in Bath.
