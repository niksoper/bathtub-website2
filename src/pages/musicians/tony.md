I grew up as a child with this old German piano but never played it or anything else until I inherited it from my father in 2009 and decided to begin lessons. My only regret is that I didn't start when I was younger!  It's been a steep learning curve as I worked my way through the grades towards grade 4 and then decided I didn't want to take any more exams! In a moment of madness I suggested to my piano teacher that it would be great to start an informal orchestra for people of all abilities to fulfil my fantasy of playing with others and having loads of fun too. Edward my teacher is now the orchestra director and the rest, as they say is history.

I can't deny its been a challenge at times for a late learner like me, but I am amazed to be playing music that I never thought I could play, and in front of audiences too!  I am also amazed at the amount of time I have spent practicing, and  I sometimes have to pinch myself that I have achieved so much in just a few years. I will never be a musical  maestro, but who cares? I can actually play stuff with others, it sounds pretty good if I work at it, and it's hugely enjoyable.
